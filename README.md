# Git Commands

## Updating your code to reflect everybody else's work
We do this often to ensure that our changes work in peace and harmony.
Otherwise... chaos.

1. Go to main branch `git checkout main` -- This is where everybody's work is saved
2. Pull the changes `git pull` -- This downloads everybody's work to your machine
3. Go back to your branch `git branch <YOUR BRANCH NAME>` example: `git branch Raiyan`
4. Time to combine! `git merge main`  -- this combines the 'main' branch of the group in step 1 to your branch in step 3

## Apply your change to your branch
1. `git add .` - This will stage all your changes
2. Check that files with the changes are in green `git status`
3. Commit message should be a statement that follows "This commit will..."  example: `git commit -m "Apply recycler view"`
4. `git push`
